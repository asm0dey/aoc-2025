== Overview

This repository contains solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2025[Advent of Code 2025], implemented in Kotlin.

== Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

----
aoc-2025/
|-- src/              # Source files
|   |-- day1.kt       # Day 1 solution
|   |-- day2.kt       # Day 2 solution
|   |-- day3.kt       # Day 3 solution
|   |-- day4.kt       # Day 4 solution
|   |-- day5.kt       # Day 5 solution
|   |-- day6.kt       # Day 6 solution
|   |-- util.kt       # Utility functions
|   `-- *.txt         # Test input files
|-- vis/              # HTML visualizations for each day
|-- build.gradle.kts  # Gradle build configuration
`-- settings.gradle.kts
----

== Prerequisites

* Java 25 or higher
* Kotlin 2.2.21

The project uses Java toolchain version 25 for compilation. The compiled bytecode targets JVM 24 for compatibility.

== Building the Project

To build the project, use the Gradle wrapper:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

On Windows, use:

[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat build
----

== Running Solutions

Each day's solution is implemented as a standalone Kotlin file with a `main` function. 

=== Using Gradle

To run a specific day's solution using the Gradle task:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runDay -Pday=1
----

On Windows:

[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat runDay -Pday=1
----

=== Manual Compilation

Alternatively, compile and run directly using the Kotlin compiler:

[source,bash]
----
kotlinc src/dayX.kt src/util.kt -include-runtime -d dayX.jar
java -jar dayX.jar
----

== Project Configuration

The project is configured with:

* *Group ID*: `com.github.asm0dey`
* *Version*: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
* *Kotlin Version*: 2.2.21
* *JVM Target*: 24
* *Java Toolchain*: 25

== Visualizations

HTML visualizations for each day's challenge are available in the `vis/` directory. These provide visual representations of the problem-solving process.

To view a visualization, open the corresponding HTML file in a web browser:

[source,bash]
----
open vis/day1.html
----

== Solution Approach

Each day's solution typically includes:

* `part1()` function: Solves the first part of the challenge
* `part2()` function: Solves the second part of the challenge
* Test input files: `dayX_t1.txt` containing sample inputs for testing

== Development

=== Adding a New Day's Solution

. Create a new file `src/dayN.kt`
. Implement the solution with `part1()` and `part2()` functions
. Add test input files as needed
. Run and verify the solution

=== Testing

The project uses JUnit Platform for testing. Run tests with:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew test
----
